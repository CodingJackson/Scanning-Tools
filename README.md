# Scanning-Tools
This repository contains my personal scanning tools... I created with python


## Walkthrough

### Banner Grab

This tool grabs the banner for you when making a GET request from the server. Just change the name of the site in calling function `con` on line 15.
Give it sometime, as this tool can take some time, due to not including the socket.timeout function.

### Advanced Python Scanner

Now this tool took me some time to create. This I created as an official tool to use on the systems, in which nmap request are banned by the firwall.
To know about the usage, just run the program without any argument. It will display a neat parsed package with the Usage of this tool...
